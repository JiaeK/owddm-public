After a refresher on old topics in February, we will focus on the opposite perspective this month.</p> <p>Two young*er* members of the meetup will go into the basics. **Jake** will be talking about how *\"**Programming from a Beginner's Perspective**\"* looks like. A perspective much needed for people that try to teach programming or want to make it easier for young ones to enter.</p> <p>After that, **Miguel** will be giving us an introduction to the *\"**Cloud Foundations**\"*, discussing the types of cloud service models, as well as sharing some tips on where to get started.</p> <p>We are looking forward to meet you again this month!</p> <p>If you are interested in contributing or joining us in broader conversations, please join [<a href=\"https://owddm.com/discord](https://owddm.com/discord\" class=\"linkified\">https://owddm.com/discord](https://owddm.com/discord</a>).</p> <p>We are also in the process of preparing next months event!
